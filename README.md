# BERTopic-paper-replication

This project is a replication of the research paper titled "BERTopic: Neural topic modeling with a class-based TF-IDF procedure" (ArXiv, 2022). The goal is to reproduce the experiments and methodologies discussed in the paper, which presents BERTopic, a novel topic modeling technique that leverages embeddings and clustering algorithms to generate coherent topics.

BERTopic aims to improve topic modeling by using a combination of Transformers, Dimension Reduction, Clustering, Count Vectorizing, and TF-IDF procedure, providing a more accurate and interpretable set of topics from large text corpora.
